Component web based development is getting very popular. Angular 1.5 introduced the component based driven technique and it is an effort to prepare the 1.x Angular projects for upgrading to Angular 2. It makes sense to start refactoring the existing Angular 1.x applications toward the component architecture if you plan to convert Angular 1 codes to Angular 2. Component driven development have been around for long time and most of the front-end web applications are following this architecture. 

A custom driven HTML web application can be considered a component with specific inputs and outputs that supplies properties on the element. So, if you are ready and accept the idea that a component architecture is important then it is beneficial to start refactoring that Angular 1.x projects to components based architecture. I really think refactoring is a good way to improve the existing codes and it does not disrupt the ongoing development
